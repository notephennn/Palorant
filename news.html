                            This week’s patch is another small one as we get closer to Masters Bangkok Finals. In it, you’ll find some small updates to minimap clarity, changes to Chamber, Skye, and Harbor’s slow behavior, and a couple bug fixes.

                            Hey folks! It’s Ash and I’m excited to be back at it again for another stellar year of VALORANT. One of my New Year’s resolutions is to hit Immortal for the first time…let’s see how that goes. What’s yours? Patch 10.01 is short but very sweet. Rank Shields have been added to Competitive Mode so when you’re in Tier 1 at 0 RR, you have 3 chances to win before dropping to the next rank below. There are also lots of bug fixes for our newest agent, Tejo.
